# Adding SendGrid to Cloud Functions

---

Now that we're safely managing our SendGrid API key in Google Secrets, we're ready to begin communicating with the SendGrid API.

We'll prepare our Cloud Function to use the SendGrid API. We can add the SendGrid npm package to our cloud function by navigating to our provided `package.json` file in the left sidebar of our Google Cloud Function.

Here, we can add a `"dependencies"` section to the existing JSON, and add `"@sendgrid/mail"` version `7.7.0`, like this:

**package.json** in Google Cloud Console
```json
{
  "name": "sample-http",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": {
    "@sendgrid/mail": "^7.7.0"
  }
}
```

Each time we deploy new code to our Google Cloud Functions, GCP automatically runs `$ npm install` as part of the build/deployment process. Which means we can add new packages directly to _package.json_, without any additional commands.

With this package now installed into our project, we can now import the SendGrid library's functionalities into the file containing our cloud function.

In the `index.js` file within the Google Cloud Console, we'll add the following `require` statement at the top of the file:

```javascript
const https = require('https');
const SENDGRID_API_KEY = process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY;
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');

[...]

```

Next, we'll begin writing a function that uses this API key to send an email. For now, we'll hard code the email details until we confirm it works:

```javascript
function compileAndSendEmailReport(orgData, learnerData, callback = () => {}){
  sgMail.setApiKey(SENDGRID_API_KEY);
  const emailObject = {
    to: 'courtney.mae.phillips+recipient@gmail.com',
    from: 'courtney.mae.phillips@gmail.com',
    subject: 'Your LMS Learner Report',
    text: "HELLO FROM THE CLOUD!"
  }
  sgMail.send(emailObject).then(() => {
      console.log('Email sent');
      callback('email sent')
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error)
      console.error("error sending")
      callback([])
    })
}
```

//NOTE ABOUT MUST USE YOUR Email

//NOTE ABOUT + NOTATION


As always, make sure to `Deploy` the updated code to ensure your changes are relected in the cloud.
