# Sending Emails from Cloud Functions

---

Now that we're safely managing our SendGrid API key in Google Secrets, we're ready to begin communicating with the SendGrid API. SendGrid will deliver LMS reports on our behalf.

## Installing Node Libraries

We can add the SendGrid npm package to our cloud function by navigating to our `package.json` file in our inline code editor.

Here, we'll add a `"dependencies"` section with `"@sendgrid/mail"` version `7.7.0`:

_**package.json** in Google Cloud Functions_
```json
{
  "name": "sample-http",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": {
    "@sendgrid/mail": "^7.7.0"
  }
}
```

Each time we deploy new code, GCP automatically runs `$ npm install`. This means we can add new packages directly to `package.json` without additional `npm` commands.

Next, we'll import the SendGrid library's functionalities into our Cloud Function with a `require` statement:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```javascript
const https = require('https');
const SENDGRID_API_KEY = process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY;
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');

[...] // file truncated for brevity

```

With this library in place, we can begin using its functionality to send an email.

We'll define a `compileAndSendEmailReport()` function that constructs the JSON payload [required by the SendGrid API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/api-getting-started). It'll include hard-coded details for now:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```javascript
const https = require('https');
const SENDGRID_API_KEY = process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY;
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');

function compileAndSendEmailReport(orgData, learnerData, callback = () => {}){
  sgMail.setApiKey(SENDGRID_API_KEY);
  const emailObject = {
    to: '<YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS-HERE>',
    from: '<YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS-HERE>',
    subject: 'Your LMS Learner Report',
    text: "HELLO FROM THE CLOUD!"
  }
  sgMail.send(emailObject).then(() => {
      console.log('Email sent');
      callback('email sent')
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error)
      console.error("error sending")
      callback([])
    })
}

[...] // file truncated for brevity
```

| ‚ö†Ô∏è  Important Note |
|--------------------|
| Once we begin calling the SendGrid API it **will send real emails**. This in mind, **use your own address** for all testing! <br><br>Want to mix it up? Gmail supports adding a suffix to existing addresses with `+`. Use this to create as many "new" addresses as you'd like. They'll all be sent to your regular inbox. (e.g. `your-email+TESTRECIPIENT@gmail.com`, `your-email+TESTREQUESTOR@gmail.com`, etc.)  |


Then, we'll call our new method in `serveLmsReport()`:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```JavaScript
[...] // file truncated for brevity

exports.serveLmsReports = (req, res) => {
  let url = 'https://mockend.com/courtneyphillips/canis-educere-mock-api/organization?companyName_eq=' + encodeURIComponent(req.body.orgName);
  https.get(url, (response) => {
    let data = '';
    response.on('data', (chunk) => {
      data += chunk;
    });
    response.on('end', () => {
      const parsedOrgData = JSON.parse(data);
      retrieveLearnerDataByOrg(parsedOrgData, (parsedLearnerData) => {
        console.log(parsedLearnerData);

        // New code to call & log our new method below!

        let emailConfirmation = compileAndSendEmailReport(parsedOrgData, parsedLearnerData);
        console.log(emailConfirmation);

        //New code above!

        res.status(200).send("Request successfully processed by the contactLMS function in GCP!")
      });
    });
  }).on('error', (err) => {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).send('Oh no, there was an error in processing your request. Check Logs for GCP and Apps Scripts.');
  });
};
```

As always, make sure to _**Deploy**_ the updated code to ensure your changes are reflected in the cloud.

You should now be able to submit another sample form, open the inbox of the email address you used in the API request, and see a new message!

Next, we can use some basic JavaScript logic to format an display the actual learner data:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```javascript
const https = require('https');
const SENDGRID_API_KEY = process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY;
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');

function compileAndSendEmailReport(orgData, learnerData, callback = () => {}){
  sgMail.setApiKey(SENDGRID_API_KEY);

  // New code to compile a report below

  let report = "";

  learnerData.forEach((learner) => {
    report += `Name: ${learner.name}\n`;
    report += `Email: ${learner.email}\n`;
    report += `Role: ${learner.roleType}\n`;
    report += `Organization ID: ${learner.organizationId}\n`;
    report += `Account Creation Date: ${learner.accountCreation}\n`;
    report += `Active Learning Hours: ${learner.activeLearningHours}\n`;
    report += `Fundamentals Certified: ${learner.fundamentalsCertified}\n`;
    report += `Advanced Skills Certified: ${learner.advancedSkillsCertified}\n`;
    report += `DevOps Certified: ${learner.devOpsCertified}\n`;
    report += `Kubernetes Certified: ${learner.kubernetesCertified}\n\n`;
  });

  // new code to compile a report above

  const emailObject = {
    to: '<YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS-HERE>',
    from: '<YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS-HERE>',
    subject: 'Your LMS Learner Report',

    // this line has been updated to use our new text report!

    text: report

    // new line above!

  }
  sgMail.send(emailObject).then(() => {
      console.log('Email sent');
      callback('email sent')
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error(error)
      console.error("error sending")
      callback([])
    })
}

[...] // file truncated for brevity
```

After deploying changes, another test form submission should reveal actual learner data in our inbox!
