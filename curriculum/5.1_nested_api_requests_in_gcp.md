# Multiple API Queries in Cloud Functions
---

Alright, our Cloud Function can now receive Google Form data via HTTP request, and use form submission data locate and return the corresponding LMS object for that organization.

### Dependent RESTful API Calls

As seen in the [API documentation](https://github.com/courtneyphillips/canis-educere-mock-api), our LMS data is RESTfully organized; each `Learner` includes an `organizationId` that corresponds to the `id` of the `Organization` they belong to.

Our Cloud Function is already returning `Organization`s from the API. We can use their returned `id`s in a second API query to locate `Learner`s belonging to that `Organization`.

Returning to the inline code editor of our Google Cloud Function, let's add a second method to handle this second API query:

**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions
```javascript
const https = require('https');

function retrieveLearnerDataByOrg(parsedOrgData, callback = () => {}) {
    let url = 'https://mockend.com/courtneyphillips/canis-educere-mock-api/learner?orgId_eq=' + encodeURIComponent(parsedOrgData[0].id);
    https.get(url, (response) => {
      let data = '';
      response.on('data', (chunk) => {
        data += chunk;
      });
      response.on('end', () => {
        const parsedLearnerData = JSON.parse(data);
        callback(parsedLearnerData);
      });
    }).on('error', (err) => {
      console.error(err);
      callback([]);
    });
  }

exports.serveLmsReports = (req, res) => {
  let url = 'https://mockend.com/courtneyphillips/canis-educere-mock-api/organization?companyName_eq=' + encodeURIComponent(req.body.orgName);
  https.get(url, (response) => {
    let data = '';
    response.on('data', (chunk) => {
      data += chunk;
    });
    response.on('end', () => {
      const parsedOrgData = JSON.parse(data);

      // make sure to call the new function to query learners after org data is received:

      let parsedLearnerData = retrieveLearnerDataByOrg(parsedOrgData);
      console.log(parsedLearnerData);

      // don't forget to add the lines above to your own code!

      res.status(200).send("Request successfully processed by the contactLMS function in GCP!")
    });
  }).on('error', (err) => {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).send('Oh no, there was an error in processing your request. Check Logs for GCP and Apps Scripts.');
  });
};
```

This new function is largely the same as the last API call we constructed together, with several minor differences:

- We don't `export` because this helper function is currently only used within this file. It is not the entry point, and does not need to be exposed.

- It accepts the Organization data returned by `serveLmsReport()` as an argument, so that it may access and insert an Organization `id` into the query URL.

- We also provide a callback as an argument, so it may report back to the parent `serveLmsReport()` function where it is invoked.

**⚠️ Don't forget to call this new function in `serveLmsReport()`, as seen above!⚠️**

After making these changes, we can **_Deploy_** our Cloud function again, wait for indication of a successful deployment, submit another sample form submission, and revisit the cloud function logs to see our learner data has been successfully returned from the LMS!
