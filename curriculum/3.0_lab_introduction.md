# Hands-On Project
---

Because serverless functions scale so readily, they can benefit individual developers as much as engineering teams.

In the rest of this module, we'll use serverless functions together in a hands-on project. We'll use Google Cloud Functions to automate compiling and delivering data. This will allow us to explore technologies used by major companies, while simultaneously creating actual internal tooling applicable to _almost any_ real life workplace.

## Scenario

For the sake of our project, we'll assume the role of a Customer Education team at a SaaS company. This team delivers certification programs and exams in the company's Learning Management System (LMS).

We'll also assume that a wide variety of folks rely on these certification programs. End users become certified to ensure they're making the most of the product, of course. But internal Support, Solution Engineering, and Product teams also require certification during onboarding. Folks in Sales may point prospects toward certs as a selling point, or recommend them to existing accounts risking of churn. Partners also use them to train their own teams. Even Marketing occasionally centers a campaign around the programs.

And each party wants LMS data from the certification programs. A customer account may want to see their engineers' certification progress. Partners and teams using it in onboarding want performance and progress reports, Marketing wants to quantify the impact of their latest campaign, etc., etc.

But...hmm...granting everyone admin access to view data isn't ideal. It's too risky, might break security policy, and provisioning accounts and training folks will be a heavy lift....

And manually compiling and delivering reports whenever they're requested is slowing down your already-busy team.

The solution? Use serverless functions to quickly spin up a self-serve reporting workflow: Allow stakeholders to submit requests through a form, and receive an email report on-demand.

### Project Preview

So, using Google Cloud Functions' serverless capability, and a few other
free tools, we're going to achieve this by doing the following:

- [ ] Create a Google Form for stakeholders to request data
- [ ] Add code to invoke a serverless Google Cloud function whenever the form is submitted
- [ ] Retrieve LMS data by calling our LMS API from Google Cloud
- [ ] Programmatically collate and format this data  
- [ ] Send it from our cloud function to the original requestor via email API
