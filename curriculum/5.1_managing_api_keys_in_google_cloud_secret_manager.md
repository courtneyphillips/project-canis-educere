# Managing Sensitive Data in the Cloud with Google Secrets Manager.
---

In programming, keys that allow. Just like you wouldn't want the password for your email or social media accounts to be published broadly, it's important to keep keys that access resources programmatically---like API keys, OAuth tokens, passwords, etc.--private and protected. Especially when they, like the SendGrid API key, potentially have the ability to send

If you've used private keys like this in previous programming endeavors, you most likely stored hte sensitive key outside of your primary codebase--such as in an environmental variable, or configuration file---and

### Key Vault Solutions

This structure of outsourcing management of sensitive values if often referred to as a **key vault**. Key vaults are services that allow developers to store and manage secrets, such as API keys, securely. The keys can be accessed by authenticated users or services using APIs or SDKs.

One of the many benefits to outsourcing some of your digital infrastructure to a cloud service provider, like AWS, GCP, or Azure, is tooling for things like key vaults.

We'll use Google Cloud Platform's key vault solution to manage our sensitive API keys for the SendGrid API. It's aptly called **Google Secret Manager**.

Create a new secret in Secret Manager

- Navigate to the Google Secret Manager Tool at `https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager` or by browsing the list of all products and selecting Secret manager.

On this page, click the blue _**Enable**_ button to enable the Secret Manager tool in your Google Cloud Platform project:

![enable-secret-manager](../assets/images/enable_secret_manager.png)

After enabling the project, you'll see a page like this. Select **_Create Secret_**.

![enable-secret-manager](../assets/images/create_secret.png)

This will load a form to create a new secret:

![new-secret-form](../assets/images/new-secret-form.png)

Give your new secret any name of your choosing (just remember what you name it!). Then, copy/paste your SendGrid API key directly into the _Secret value_ form field. You are not required to upload a file.

| ⚠️  Important Note |
|--------------------|
| Be **very careful** to ensure your API Key is copied over _exactly_ how it appears in SendGrid. A small missing character will cause authorization failures down the line. Even an extra whitespace--nearly invisible to the human eye--can cause difficult-to-diagnose issues. _Ask me how I know._ |

Once you're certain the secret value contains your precise API Key, click _**Create Secret**_.

You'll be taken to a page where you can later manager your secret; including viewing, enabling, disabling, and destroying:

.

Next, return to your Cloud Function in the Google Cloud Console. Select the **_Edit_** option near the top of the page:

![edit-option-in-gcp](../assets/images/edit_option_in_gcp_cloud.png)

On the first edit page, locate and expand the section titled _**Runtime, build, connections and security settings**_

![security-settings](../assets/images/security_options_in_gcp_cloud_functions.png)

In this panel, select the _**Security and Image Repo Options**_ tab. You should see a link reading **_Reference a Secret_**. Click this link:

![reference-a-secret](../assets/images/security_and_image_repo_options.png)

* `Secret`: Select the secret under the name you just created.
* `Reference method`: For our tutorial, we'll select **expose as an environmental variable**.
* In the ENvironmental Variables section; Name, version 1 is fine.
* Below the name of the secret, you'll see a "The lms-automation-380021@appspot.gserviceaccount.com service account does not have permissions to access selected secret." Click the blue **_Grant_** option to give your project access to this specific secret.
