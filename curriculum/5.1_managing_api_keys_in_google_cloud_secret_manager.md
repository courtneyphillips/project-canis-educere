# Managing Keys with Google Cloud Secret Manager
---

Securely managing sensitive values is another complexity of programming Google Cloud Platform can help abstract away for us.

GCP offers a tool called Google Secret Manager. It can be used to encrypt and store sensitive values (e.g. passwords, API keys, certificates, etc.), and dole out access through fine-grained authentication policies.

We'll use Google Secret Manager to handle our new SendGrid API key.  

## Creating a New Secret

Navigate to the Google Secret Manager Tool by [**clicking this link**](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager). On the resulting page, click _**Enable**_:

![enable-secret-manager](../assets/images/enable_secret_manager.png)

After enabling, select **_Create Secret_**.

![enable-secret-manager](../assets/images/create_secret.png)

This will load a form to create a new secret:

![new-secret-form](../assets/images/new-secret-form.png)

Give your new secret a _**Name**_ of your choosing. Copy/paste your SendGrid API key into the _**Secret value**_ field.

| ‚ö†Ô∏è  Important Note |
|--------------------|
| Be **very careful** to ensure your API Key is copied over _exactly_ how it appears in SendGrid.  Even an extra whitespace‚Äînearly invisible to the human eye‚Äîcan cause difficult-to-diagnose issues. _**Ask me how I know.**_ üò¨ |

Once you're certain everything is correct, click _**Create Secret**_.

## Managing Secrets

You'll navigate to a page where you can manage your secret; including viewing, enabling, disabling, and destroying:

![secrets detail page in GCP](../assets/images/secret_details_page.png)

## Providing Secrets to Cloud Functions

Next, return to your Cloud Function. Select **_Edit_**:

![edit-option-in-gcp](../assets/images/edit_option_in_gcp_cloud.png)

On the first edit page, locate and expand the section titled _**Runtime, build, connections and security settings**_:

![security-settings](../assets/images/security_options_in_gcp_cloud_functions.png)

In this panel, select the _**Security and Image Repo Options**_ tab. You should see a link reading **_Reference a Secret_**. Click this link:

![reference-a-secret](../assets/images/security_and_image_repo_options.png)

This will open a form. From the _**Secret**_ dropdown, select the secret you just created.

A message below the dropdown will appear, stating your project doesn't have permission to access this secret. Click _**Grant**_.

![reference-a-secret](../assets/images/reference_a_secret_in_cloud_function.png)

Complete the form by selecting _**Expose as environmental variable**_. This will reveal further variable options.

Give your environmental variable a name. **This will be the variable name you call directly in your code.**

![naming env variables](../assets/images/naming_env_variables.png)

Click _**Done**_. Review your configurations, then click **_Next_**.

This will take you back to the inline editor. From here, we can access our new environmental variable at the top of our file:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```JavaScript
const https = require('https');
const SENDGRID_API_KEY = process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY;

// Make sure the line above references YOUR environmental variable name!

[...] // file truncated for brevity
```
