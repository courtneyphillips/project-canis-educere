# Google Form Setup

## Creating a Google Form

First we'll need a Google Form. This self-serve resource will allow stakeholders to request up-to-date LMS metrics on customers using the LMS.

**Click [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WWOQb1rrzaG91OU0jwOK8i9YSo9Ka2eyiJUeLMTUSWU/copy)** to make a copy of the Google Form used in this project. You will see a prompt like this:

![Google prompt in a pop-up window offering to make copy of provided Google Form](../assets/images/copy_google_form.png "Select 'Make a copy' to copy the Google Form required for this project")

Click **_Make a copy_**. Keep this up in your browser throughout this module. Do not alter the questions or settings provided.

## Saving Form Submissions in a Spreadsheet

Next, we'll configure our form to record responses in a Google Sheet. This will serve as both a record of all requests, and an entry point to launch our serverless automation.  

In your copy of the form, select the **_Responses_** tab, then click **_Link to Sheets_**.

![Edit view for a Google form](../assets/images/link_form_responses_to_google_sheets.png "Navigate to the 'Responses' tab, then 'Link to Sheets'")

You will be prompted to either select an existing sheet, or make a new sheet. Select **_Create a new spreadsheet_**, then **_Create_**.

![Google Forms prompt asking user to select between new or existing spreadsheet to store Form responses](../assets/images/create_new_spreadsheet_for_form_responses.png "Select the 'Create a new spreadsheet' option, then click 'Create'")

You will then see your new Google Sheet. Keep this and your Google Form available in your browser; we'll use them momentarily.

### Testing the Form

Let's confirm it works! Revisit your Google Form, select **_Preview_** (üëÅÔ∏è) in the upper-right of the top toolbar. From here, you can submit test information into your form, and see it appear as a new row in the corresponding spreadsheet. Great!
