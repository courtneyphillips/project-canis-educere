## Google Form Setup

### Creating a Google Form

First we'll need a Google Form. This self-serve resource will allow stakeholders to request up-to-date LMS metrics on customers using the LMS.

**Click [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WWOQb1rrzaG91OU0jwOK8i9YSo9Ka2eyiJUeLMTUSWU/copy)** to make a copy of the Google Form used in this project. You will see a prompt like this:

![Google prompt in a pop-up window offering to make copy of provided Google Form](../assets/images/copy_google_form.png "Select 'Make a copy' to copy the Google Form required for this project")

Click _Make a copy_. Keep this up in your browser throughout this module. But do not alter the questions or settings provided.

NOTES: /// do we want to discuss why the form is a drop-down menu for the purposes of this project (e.g. working with a small sample data set instead of expansive LMS API...)

### Saving Form Submissions in a Spreadsheet

Next, we'll configure our form to record responses in a Google Sheet. This will serve as both a record of all requests, and an entry point to launch our upcoming cloud-based automation.  

In your copy of the form, select the _Responses_ tab, then click _Link to Sheets_.

![Edit view for a Google form](../assets/images/link_form_responses_to_google_sheets.png "Navigate to the 'Responses' tab, then 'Link to Sheets'")

You will be prompted to either select an existing sheet, or make a new sheet. Select _Create a new spreadsheet_, then _Create_.

![Google Forms prompt asking user to select between new or existing spreadsheet to store Form responses](../assets/images/create_new_spreadsheet_for_form_responses.png "Select the 'Create a new spreadsheet' option, then click 'Create'")

You will automatically be taken to your new spreadsheet in Google Sheets. Keep this up in your browser too, we'll be using it throughout the next few lessons.

### Testing the Form

Let's confirm everything works! Revisit your Google Form, select _Preview_. From here, you can submit test information into your form, and see it appear in the corresponding Google Spreadsheet. Great!
