## Google Form Setup

### Creating a Google Form

First we'll need a Google Form. This self-serve resource will allow stakeholders to independently request up-to-date LMS metrics on any customer organization using our LMS.

**Click [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WWOQb1rrzaG91OU0jwOK8i9YSo9Ka2eyiJUeLMTUSWU/copy)** to make a copy of the Google Form used throughout this project. You will see a prompt like this:

![Google prompt in a pop-up window offering to make copy of provided Google Form](../assets/images/copy_google_form.png "Select 'Make a copy' to copy the Google Form required for this project")

Click the blue _Make a copy_ button. You will navigate to your personal copy of the form. Do not alter the questions or settings provided on your demo form.

NOTES: /// do we want to discuss why the form is a drop-down menu for the purposes of this project (e.g. working with a small sample data set instead of expansive LMS API...)

### Saving Form Submissions in a Spreadsheet

Next, we'll configure our Google Form to record responses in a Google Sheet. This sheet will serve as a record of all requests made through the form. It will also serve as an entry point to launch our custom workflow.  

In your copy of the Google Form, select the _Responses_ tab. Then, click _Link to Sheets_.

![Edit view for a Google form](../assets/images/link_form_responses_to_google_sheets.png "Navigate to the 'Responses' tab, then 'Link to Sheets'")

You will be prompted to select an existing sheet, or make a new sheet. Select _Create a new spreadsheet_, then click _Create_.

![Google Forms prompt asking user to select between new or existing spreadsheet to store Form responses](../assets/images/create_new_spreadsheet_for_form_responses.png "Select the 'Create a new spreadsheet' option, then click 'Create'")

You will automatically be taken to your new spreadsheet in Google Sheets.

### Testing the Form

Let's confirm everything works! Revisit your Google Form, select _Preview_. From here, you can submit test information into your form, and see it appear in the corresponding Google Spreadsheet. Great! Now that we know what will occur everytime an internal stakeholder submits a request through the form, we can associate automated scripts to listen for this behavior...
