### Gathering and Sending Dynamic Parameters

Now that we know they're communicating, let's send the data that stakeholders submit in our form to the GCP cloud function. Our cloud function will eventually be responsible for pulling and sending data from our LMS. This will inform it which data to send.

We'll add `event` as an argument to our method to capture details about form submission triggering our function. Details provided in form fields are stored in a `values` array on the `event` object. We can

Then, in our payload, we're accessing the details of this event to capture what the user has submitted in form fields:

```JavaScript
const cloudFunctionsLocation = "YOUR-UNIQUE-CLOUD-FUNCTIONS-URL-HERE";

function onNewFormSubmission(event) {
  let payloadToSendToGCP = {
    "method": "POST",
    "payload": JSON.stringify(
      {
        "requestorEmail": event.values[1],
        "orgName": event.values[2],
      }
    )
  }
  let response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(cloudFunctionsLocation, payloadToSendToGCP);
  let result = response.getContentText();
  console.log(result);
}
```

If we submit through our form preview once again and revisit the Apps Script execution logs, we should see another completed execution, with the same `Hello World!` message from GCP:

Great, that means our HTTP request to GCP was successful! But did it receive our new dynamic parameters? Let's check!

update GCP function:

```javascript
exports.helloWorld = (req, res) => {
  let message = req.query.message || req.body.message || 'Hello World!';
  console.log(req.body);
  res.status(200).send(message);
};
```

redeploy. wait a second for green checkmark. send anotehr form. check gcp logs. BOOM, REQUEST!
