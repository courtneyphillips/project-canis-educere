# Cloud Services

<explain that cloud is a general term, there's actually a specific menu of services each offers>.

Each cloud provider offers an extensive list of services. (For example, [provider] currently offers [X] unique services as of this writing, ranging from Y to Z....)

This course won't cover each in detail, but here are the general categories of most common services:

## Computational Resources

Running logic, VMs, serverless, etc. (are some of these their own category? This is a very large category...)

<Call out that our lab will dive into this hands-on?>

### Storage

Buckets, databases, etc.

### Networking

Load balancers, etc.

### Analytics

### Security

Cloud introduces more security risks, considering 'off-site' nature...providers offer

### DevOps

Tools needed to develop the apps and logic and fun!

### Applied/Artificial Intelligence

Newer field, machine learning, etc. <Include this? Kind of opens a can of worms, eh?>
