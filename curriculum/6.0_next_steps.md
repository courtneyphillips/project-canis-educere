# Conclusion & Next Steps
---

After following along with all previous lessons in this module, we learned how to:

- Create and invoke event-based triggers in Google Apps Scripts.
- Follow best practices to obfuscate sensitive values in Google Cloud Platform using Google Cloud Secrets Manager
- Bridge two disparate APIs by means of cloud functions
- Create, configure, and access a new project in Google Cloud Platform
- Author and deploy a basic Cloud Function in JavaScript and Node.js using Google Cloud Platform
- Access, review, and analyze execution logs for both Google Apps Script and Google Cloud Functions
- Create, execute, and manage interdependent HTTP GET and POST requests from cloud functions
- Obfuscate and access sensitive keys in the cloud using Google Secrets Manager
- Identify and explain use cases for Cloud Functions (vs. other logic solutions)
- Describe the relationship between cloud computing, functions-as-a-service, and serverless functions.
- Articulate the value of serverless functions.  
- Construct and execute a serverless function on Google Cloud Platform.
- Identify potential use cases for serverless functions.

## Further Exploration

Interested in taking this project further? Or integrating a similar workflow at a workplace or other organization? Here's some ideas for going above and beyond:

- Dynamic templates in SendGrid
- More insightful calculatijons
- Create visual Google Data Studio report instead of plaintext email
- Stricter security and authentication protocols, to ensure learner data is only being given out to those who should access
- Custom SendGrid domain
- Query other available APIs and data for more holistic user reports (attendance at in-person conferences and events, Salesforce data, Saas product consumption information, etc.)
- customize reports (are there specific metrics the user is looking for? specific certs?)
