# Hands-On Project
---

Because serverless functions scale so readily, they can benefit individual developers as much as engineering teams.

In the rest of this module, we'll use serverless functions together in a hands-on project. We'll use Google Cloud Functions to automate compiling and delivering data. This will allow us to explore technologies used by major companies, while simultaneously creating actual internal tooling that could be put to use in _almost any_ real life workplace today.

## Scenario

For this project, we'll assume the role of a Customer Education team at a SaaS company. This team delivers certification programs through the company's Learning Management System (LMS).

A wide variety of folks rely on these programs. End users become certified to ensure they're making the most of the product, of course. But internal Support, Solution Engineering, and Product teams also lean on certs for onboarding. Sales recommends them to existing accounts risking of churn, etc., etc.

And each party wants LMS data from the certification programs. A customer account may want to see their engineers' certification progress. Partners and teams using it in onboarding want performance and progress reports, Marketing wants to quantify the impact of their latest campaign, etc., etc.

But this creates a problem for the education team: Granting everyone admin access to data isn't ideal. Nor is manually compiling and delivering reports on demand. (The team already has their hands full!)

The solution? Create a self-serve workflow. Allow stakeholders to submit their requests through a form, and automatically receive an email report.

## Project Preview

How will we do this? Here's our plan:

- [ ] Create a Google Form for stakeholders to request reports on misc. user organizations.  (e.g. progress toward certifications, active LMS hours, etc.)
- [ ] Run a Google Cloud function when the form receives submissions.
- [ ] Query the LMS API from Google Cloud.
- [ ] Collate and format API data into a report.
- [ ] Email this report to the requestor(s) using the SendGrid API.
