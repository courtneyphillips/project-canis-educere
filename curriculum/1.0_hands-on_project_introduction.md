# Hands-On Project
---

In this module, we'll explore serverless functions together in a hands-on project. We'll use [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/overview#:~:text=Google%20Cloud%20Functions%20is%20a,event%20being%20watched%20is%20fired.) to build a self-serve cloud workflow that can collect, compile, and deliver data on-demand.

One of the coolest things about serverless functions is that‚Äîdue to their extreme scaleability‚Äîthey can benefit individual developers and small projects just as much as huge engineering teams.

By building this real-world-applicable automation, we'll learn about technology used by major software companies, while simultaneously creating internal tooling that could add value to _almost any_ workplace _today_. Win-win!

## Scenario

For this project, we'll assume the role of a Customer Education team at a SaaS company. This team delivers certification programs through a Learning Management System (LMS).

Many folks rely on these programs. Most importantly, customers become certified to ensure they're making the most of the product. But internal Support, Solution Engineering, and Product teams also lean on certs for onboarding and education efforts. Sales recommends them to struggling accounts, Marketing occasionally centers a campaign around them, etc., etc.

And each party wants LMS data from the certification programs.

- Customers want to see their engineers' progress and performance.
- Teams using it in onboarding want data to base program design decisions upon.
- Marketing wants to quantify the impact of their latest certification campaign.

...and so on, and so forth...you get the picture.

But this creates a _**problem**_: Granting everyone admin access to LMS data isn't ideal. Nor is manually compiling and delivering reports on-demand. (The team already has their hands full!)

The solution? **Create a self-serve workflow.** Allow stakeholders to submit their requests through a form, and automatically receive an email report.

## Project Preview

How will we do this? Here's our plan:

- [ ] Create a **Google Form** for stakeholders to request reports on misc. user organizations in the LMS.
- [ ] Run a **Google Cloud Function** when the form receives submissions.
- [ ] Query the **LMS API** from Google Cloud.
- [ ] Collate and format API data into a report.
- [ ] Email this report to the requestor(s) using the **SendGrid API**.
