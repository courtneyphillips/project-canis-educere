# Event-Based Logic with Google Apps Script   
---

Next we'll integrate code to send collected form data to the cloud, where we'll eventually use it to compile and send our reports. Google Sheets supports more expansive scripting than Forms, so we'll add this code to our spreadsheet.

Navigate to the spreadsheet we just created. Select **_Extensions_** > **_Apps Script_** from the top menu bar.

![Screenshot depicting user selecting the Extensions option from the Google Sheets toolbar, and clicking Apps Script from the resulting dropdown menu](../assets/images/accessing_apps_script_from_google_sheets.png "App Scripts can be accessed by selecting Extensions > Apps Script from the top toolbar in Google Sheets'")

| üõ†Ô∏è  Project Note |
|--------------------|
| _If this is your first time using Google Apps Script, you may be receive a pop-up asking for permissions. Accept all suggested permissions and proceed._ |

This will take you to a new Apps Script project:

Because we created this project from our spreadsheet, code here will automatically be associated with our sheet.

Let's rename the provided `myFunction()` and insert a logging statement:

**Code.gs** in Apps Script
```javascript
function onNewFormSubmission(){
  console.log("hey, our function was invoked!")
}
```

| ‚ö†Ô∏è  Important  |
|--------------------|
| The Apps Script editor **_does not automatically save your work_**. Save manually after each change by clicking the save icon (üíæ), or using the shortcut `CMD + S` on Mac, or `Ctrl + S` on Windows. |

## Defining Triggers

Next, we'll tell the function when to run. In the left sidebar of Apps Script, select **_Triggers_** (‚è∞). On the resulting page, click **_Add Trigger_** in the lower-right:

![Google Apps Script interface, with options for Triggers and Add New Trigger emphasized ](../assets/images/adding_new_trigger_to_apps_script.png)

A modal with configuration options will appear. Update each to match the following:

- **Choose which function to run**: `onNewFormSubmission`

- **Choose which deployment should run**: `Head`. This refers to the version meant for publication (as opposed to testing or development). It's a bit like a Git `master` branch.

- **Select event source**: `From spreadsheet`.

- **Select event type**: `On form submit`. Our spreadsheet is configured to automatically register new form submissions. When it receives this type of event, it will now also run our `onNewFormSubmission()` function.

- **Failure notification settings**: Your choice. We will walk through checking log data to locate errors, but you may opt for notifications.

Click the blue _**Save**_ button after confirming your settings match.

## Invoking Triggers & Viewing Logs

We just told our `onNewFormSubmission()` function to run whenever the form is submitted; let's see it in action!

Revisit the form, fill out the fields, and submit it. A second row will be appended to your spreadsheet:

But did `onNewFormSubmission()` run when the form was submitted? In Apps Script, `console.log()`s are recorded in Execution Logs. These are accessed through the **_Executions_** option in the left sidebar:

![Screenshot Google Sheet with two rows of form data visible ](../assets/images/executions_in_apps_script.png)

Each entry on this page represents an instance of our function running. We can expand the latest entry to see our `console.log()` message:

![Screenshot Google Sheet with two rows of form data visible ](../assets/images/log_message_visible_in_executions_log.png)

Great! Our function runs automatically when our form is submitted.
