An "intro to cloud services" lesson could cover a wide range of topics, but here are some of the key concepts and topics that could be covered:

Cloud computing basics: This could include an overview of the cloud computing paradigm, including the three main service models (Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service) and the four main deployment models (public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and multi-cloud).

Benefits of cloud services: This could cover the key benefits of cloud computing, such as scalability, flexibility, cost savings, reliability, and security.

Cloud service providers: This could include an overview of the major cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and IBM Cloud.

Cloud computing services: This could cover the different types of cloud services offered by cloud providers, such as compute, storage, networking, databases, machine learning, analytics, security, and more.

Cloud deployment models: This could cover the different ways in which organizations can deploy their applications and services in the cloud, including public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud, and multi-cloud.

Cloud security: This could cover the different security measures that cloud providers offer to protect their customers' data, including physical security, network security, data encryption, access controls, and more.

Cloud migration: This could cover the process of moving an organization's applications and services from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud, including the different migration strategies and tools that can be used.

Cloud pricing models: This could cover the different pricing models used by cloud providers, such as pay-as-you-go, reserved instances, and spot instances.

Cloud-native development: This could cover the best practices and tools for developing applications that are designed to run natively in the cloud, such as microservices architecture, containers, and serverless computing.

Overall, an "intro to cloud services" lesson could provide a high-level overview of the key concepts and topics related to cloud computing, as well as some practical guidance on how to get started with using cloud services.


# The Rise of Cloud Computing

In order to fully grasp reasoning and context <better terms here> and system design decisions behind serverless programming, it's important to first understand the basic cloud computing trends, technologies, and offerings made available in recent years. Let's review:

## The Cloud

As you likely know, most all websites, apps, and technical infrastructure require (at bare minimum) the same general core ingredients:

- **Servers** to load up and offer their content, websites, and materials.
- **Storage** to retain information, such as user accounts, files, or whatever the
- **Resources** to run logic and calculations necessary for the core functionality of the program. Computing power, essentially.

Until recently, engineers and developers creating and maintaining these systems also had to create and maintain the hardware and software necessary for these core ingredients. That meant things like.... <server maintenance, etc.>

<creative commons photo of server racks, other infrastructure>

There were several major problems with this setup, including:

1. Scaleability:
2. Cost: <not only monetary cost, but time and resource spend maintaining these machines>
3. Portability:

The cloud gained traction as a response to all of these problems, and more. When we say 'the cloud' or "cloud computing" we are simply referring to offsite computational resources and infrastructure that are accessed over the internet as a service, managed by another party.

This means instead of a company, individual, or team managing their own hardware and computational resources---like the servers, storage, and resources we discussed earlier---they can outsource this infrastructure to another provider on-demand that maanages this infrastructure for them.

This system directly addresses each of the following problems we reviewed above:

1. Scaleability:
2. Cost:
3. Portability:

## Cloud Providers

Technically, cloud computing refers to any infrastructure in which teh maintenance of hardware and systems is abstracted away from the developer or engineer.

However, three main players ... Here's an overview of each

| Header One     | Header Two     | Header Three  | Header Four
| :------------- | :------------- |:------------- |
| Item One       | Item Two       |Item Two       |Item Two       |

# Cloud Services

Now, as we just established, "the cloud" or cloud computing is a general term referring to abstracting away systems and infrastructure to a third-party, then accessing them over the internet.

Each cloud provider offers an extensive list of services. (For example, [provider] currently offers [X] unique services as of this writing, ranging from Y to Z....)

This course won't cover each in detail, but here are the general categories of most common services:

## Computational Resources

Running logic, VMs, serverless, etc. (are some of these their own category? This is a very large category...)

<Call out that our lab will dive into this hands-on?>

### Storage

Buckets, databases, etc.

### Networking

Load balancers, etc.

### Analytics

### Security

Cloud introduces more security risks, considering 'off-site' nature...providers offer

### DevOps

Tools needed to develop the apps and logic and fun!

### Applied/Artificial Intelligence

Newer field, machine learning, etc. <Include this? Kind of opens a can of worms, eh?>
