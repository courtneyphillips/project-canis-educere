# Setting up SendGrid
---

Great! Our Cloud Function is accessing all the necessary information to generate LMS reports on a given organization.

Next we need to compile and email this information to the requestor. To do this, we'll use the SendGrid API.

## Creating a Free SendGrid Account

If you don't already have one, register for [**a new SendGrid account on their website**](https://signup.sendgrid.com).

After logging into your new account, Locate the _**Settings**_ option in the left sidebar. Under _**Settings**_, select _**API Keys**_.

![accessing-sendgrid-api-key](../assets/images/accessing_api_keys_in_sendgrid.png)

On the API keys page, click _**Create API Key**_:

![sendgrid-api-key](../assets/images/create_sendgrid_api_key.png)

Give your key a descriptive _**Key Name**_ you will remember. Select either _**Full**_ or _**Restricted**_ access that **includes mail send capabilities**.

![sendgrid-api-key-form](../assets/images/sendgrid_api_key_form.png)

Click _**Create & View**_ to see your new key.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Capture your API key immediately** ‚ö†Ô∏è. If you navigate away from this page, SendGrid will not re-display your key. Keep this tab open throughout the next lesson. Or copy/paste into a temporary local file now.
