# Invoking a Cloud Function via HTTP
---

We already have four pieces of our automated self-serve workflow in place:

1. A **form** for users to request LMS reports.
2. A **spreadsheet** that captures requests.
3. A **trigger** on our spreadsheet to execute logic when a new form submission event occurs.
4. A **cloud function** that will trigger upon receiving an HTTP request.

Excellent progress!

Next up, we'll begin weaving these pieces together into a holistic, connected workflow. Specifically, we'll update our Apps Script to invoke our Cloud Function via an HTTPS request whenever a form is submitted.

Let's revisit our Apps Script code. It currently looks like this:

_**Code.gs** in Google Apps Script_
```JavaScript
function onNewFormSubmission(){
  console.log("hey, our function was invoked!")
}
```

## Building an HTTP Request

Let's add the ability to contact the cloud. We'll provide our Cloud Functions URL, and construct a barebones HTTP POST request:

_**Code.gs** in Google Apps Script_
```javascript
const cloudFunctionsLocation = "YOUR-UNIQUE-CLOUD-FUNCTIONS-URL-HERE";

function onNewFormSubmission() {
  let payloadToSendToGCP = {
    "method": "POST",
    "contentType": "application/json"
  }
}
```

| üõ†Ô∏è  Project Note |
|--------------------|
| If you didn't record your Cloud Function URL in the previous lesson, revisit your function in the Cloud Console. Locate and select the _**Edit**_ option. Scroll to the `Trigger URL` value. This is your Cloud Functions URL.  |

## Sending an HTTP Request

Next, let's add logic to send our HTTP request. Apps Script offers a built-in HTTP client called [**UrlFetchApp**](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app). We'll use its [`fetch()` method](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app#fetch(String,Object) to make a request. This provided method returns the HTTP response, which we will log it to the console:

_**Code.gs** in Google Apps Script_
```javascript
const cloudFunctionsLocation = "YOUR-UNIQUE-CLOUD-FUNCTIONS-URL-HERE";

function onNewFormSubmission() {
  let payloadToSendToGCP = {
    "method": "POST",
    "contentType": "application/json"
  }
  let response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(cloudFunctionsLocation, payloadToSendToGCP);
  let result = response.getContentText();
  console.log(result);
}
```

This will send an HTTP POST request to the URL location of our Cloud Function.

As you may recall, our Cloud Function currently either sends a `Hello World!` (or the request `message` or `query` in response:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```JavaScript
exports.helloWorld = (req, res) => {
  let message = req.query.message || req.body.message || 'Hello World!';
  res.status(200).send(message);
};
```

Our HTTP request doesn't include a `message` or  `query`. If we receive a `Hello World!` we'll know it successfully made contact with the cloud.

Let's try it out! Revisit and resubmit sample data through your form. In another tab, revisit the App Scripts Executions log. Expanding the most recent entry should reveal a `Hello World!` from the cloud!

<details><summary>‚õî **Did you receive a log error?**: Click here for guidance </summary>
<br>
<p>
If you received an Apps Script log error reading <b>Exception: You do not have permission to call UrlFetchApp.fetch.</b>, it is because Apps Script does not have authorization to make HTTP requests from your account.
</p>
<p>
To grant permissions, return to the Apps Script editor. Click <b><em>Run</b></em> (‚ñ∂Ô∏è). You'll see an <em>Authorization required</em> pop-up. Click <em>Review permissions</em>. You may receive another pop-up warning <em>Google hasn't verified this app</em>. At the bottom of this window is a tiny link reading <em>Advanced</em>. Click this. A menu will expand, reading <em>"Continue only if you understand the risks and trust the developer (YOUR-GOOGLE-ACCOUNT@gmail.com)."</em>
</p>
<p>
Now, this warning may feel alarming. But notice that the developer you are entrusting is <b><em>yourself</b></em>. You are granting yourself the ability to run `UrlFetchApp` on your own account. Click the small link reading <em>Go to Untitled project (unsafe)</em>. Click <em>Allow</em> in the next screen.
</p>
<p>
At the conclusion of this module, we'll give you a reminder to optionally revoke these permissions (along with disabling API keys and other sensitive information created for this course).
</p>
<p>
After allowing these permissions, revisit and repeat the instructions in the paragraph above this panel.
