# Invoking a Cloud Function via HTTP
---

We already have four pieces of our automated self-serve workflow in place:

1. A **form** for users to request LMS reports.
2. A **spreadsheet** that captures requests.
3. A **trigger** on our spreadsheet to execute logic when a new form submission event occurs.
4. A **cloud function** that will trigger upon receiving an HTTP request.

Excellent progress!

Next up, we'll begin weaving these pieces together into a connected workflow. Specifically, we'll update our Apps Script to invoke our Cloud Function via an HTTP request whenever a form is submitted.

Let's revisit our Apps Script code. It currently looks like this:

_**Code.gs** in Google Apps Script_
```JavaScript
function onNewFormSubmission(){
  console.log("hey, our function was invoked!")
}
```

## Building an HTTP Request

Let's add the ability to contact the cloud. We'll provide our Cloud Functions URL, and construct a simple HTTP POST request:

_**Code.gs** in Google Apps Script_
```javascript
const cloudFunctionsLocation = "YOUR-UNIQUE-CLOUD-FUNCTIONS-URL-HERE";

function onNewFormSubmission() {
  let payloadToSendToGCP = {
    "method": "POST",
    "contentType": "application/json"
  }
}
```

| üõ†Ô∏è  Project Note |
|--------------------|
| Locate your Cloud Function's URL by navigating to the function in the Google Cloud Console, selecting _**Edit**_, and scrolling to the `Trigger URL` value.   |

## Sending an HTTP Request

Next, let's send our new HTTP request. Apps Script offers a built-in HTTP client called [**UrlFetchApp**](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app). We'll use its [`fetch()` method](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app#fetch) to make a request.

`fetch()` returns the HTTP response, which we will log it to the console:

_**Code.gs** in Google Apps Script_
```javascript
const cloudFunctionsLocation = "YOUR-UNIQUE-CLOUD-FUNCTIONS-URL-HERE";

function onNewFormSubmission() {
  let payloadToSendToGCP = {
    "method": "POST",
    "contentType": "application/json"
  }
  let response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(cloudFunctionsLocation, payloadToSendToGCP);
  let result = response.getContentText();
  console.log(result);
}
```

This will send an HTTP POST request to the URL location of our Cloud Function.

Our Cloud Function should send a `Hello World!` in response to HTTP requests without `message` values:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```JavaScript
exports.helloWorld = (req, res) => {
  let message = req.query.message || req.body.message || 'Hello World!';
  res.status(200).send(message);
};
```

The request we're sending from Apps Script doesn't include a `message` or  `query`. But if we receive `Hello World!` we'll know it successfully made contact with the cloud.

Let's try it out! Revisit and resubmit sample data through your form. In another tab, revisit the App Scripts Executions log. Expanding the most recent entry should reveal a `Hello World!` from the cloud!

<details><summary>‚õî <b>Did you receive a log error instead?</b>: Click here for guidance </summary>
<br>
<p>
If you received an Apps Script log error reading <b>Exception: You do not have permission to call UrlFetchApp.fetch.</b>, it is because Apps Script does not have authorization to make HTTP requests from your account.
</p>
<p>
To grant permissions, return to the Apps Script editor. Click <b><em>Run</b></em> (‚ñ∂Ô∏è). You'll see an <em>Authorization required</em> pop-up. Click <em>Review permissions</em>. You may receive another pop-up warning <em>Google hasn't verified this app</em>. At the bottom of this window is a tiny link reading <em>Advanced</em>. Click this. A menu will expand, reading <em>"Continue only if you understand the risks and trust the developer (YOUR-GOOGLE-ACCOUNT@gmail.com)."</em>
</p>
<p>
Now, this warning may feel alarming. But notice that the developer you are entrusting is <b><em>yourself</b></em>. You are granting yourself the ability to run <code>UrlFetchApp</code> on your own account. Click the small link reading <em>Go to Untitled project (unsafe)</em>. Click <em>Allow</em> in the next screen.
</p>
<p>
After allowing these permissions, revisit and repeat the instructions in the paragraph above this panel.
