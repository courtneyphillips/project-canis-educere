# Triggering a Cloud Function via HTTP
---

We now have three important pieces of our automated self-serve process in place:

1. A form for users to self-serve their LMS report requests
2. A spreadsheet that captures data and automatically executes logic whenever new form submissions are received.
3. A cloud function that will trigger upon receipt of an HTTP request.

Our next step is to connect these pieces into a singular workflow. Specifically, we'll update our sheet script to invoke our cloud function via HTTP. After confirming they can communicate, we'll pass actual form input data to the cloud function.

## Contacting a Cloud Function via HTTP

Let's revisit the Apps Script code attached to our form and spreadsheet. It currently looks like this:

**code.gs** in Google Apps Script
```JavaScript
function onNewFormSubmission(){
  console.log("hey, our function was invoked!")
}
```

Let's update it to contact the cloud. We'll provide our Cloud Functions URL, and construct an HTTP request:

**code.gs** in Google Apps Script
```javascript
const cloudFunctionsLocation = "YOUR-UNIQUE-CLOUD-FUNCTIONS-URL-HERE";

function onNewFormSubmission() {
  let payloadToSendToGCP = {
    "method": "POST",
    "contentType": "application/json",
    "payload": JSON.stringify({"message": "Hello, cloud function! How's the weather up there?"})
  }
}
```

_(If you didn't record this in the previous lesson, revisit your cloud function in the GCP dashboard. Hit _Edit_ and scroll down to the `Trigger URL` value)_

Then we'll send our HTTP request. Conveniently, Apps Script has a built-in HTTP client called [UrlFetchApp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app).We'll use its [`fetch()` method](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app#fetch(String,Object)) to make a simple request, grab the response text, and log it to the console:

**code.gs** in Google Apps Script
```javascript
const cloudFunctionsLocation = "YOUR-UNIQUE-CLOUD-FUNCTIONS-URL-HERE";

function onNewFormSubmission() {
  let payloadToSendToGCP = {
    "method": "POST",
    "contentType": "application/json",
    "payload": JSON.stringify({"message": "Hello, cloud function! How's the weather up there?"})
  }
  let response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(cloudFunctionsLocation, payloadToSendToGCP);
  let result = response.getContentText();
  console.log(result);
}
```

This function will attempt to contact our GCP Cloud function at the URL location provided, via HTTP POST request.

Our cloud function currently sends a `Hello World!` back in response to any request:

**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions
```JavaScript
exports.helloWorld = (req, res) => {
  let message = req.query.message || req.body.message || 'Hello World!';
  res.status(200).send(message);
};
```

So, if the HTTP request sent by our Apps Script receives a `Hello World!`, we'll know it successfully made contact with the cloud.

Let's try it out! Revisit and resubmit sample data through your form. In another tab, revisit the App Scripts Executions log. Expanding the most recent entry should reveal a `Hello World!` from the cloud!

<details><summary>‚õî **Did you receive a log error?**: Click here for guidance </summary>
<br>
<p>
If you received an Apps Script log error reading `Exception: You do not have permission to call UrlFetchApp.fetch.`, it is because Apps Script does not have authorization to make HTTP requests from your Google Account.
</p>
<p>
To grant permissions, return to the Apps Script editor. Click **_Run_** (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) in the top toolbar. You'll see a pop-up asking for permissions. Enable them. You may receive another pop-up warning _Google hasn't verified this app_. At the bottom of this window is a tiny link reading _Go to [project name] (unsafe)_. Click this. In the resulting pop-up you will have the option to allow permissions.
</p>
<p>
It may feel questionable to ignore these warnings--but notice **you** are listed as both the developer and the party granting permission. You are allowing your own script access to your own account.
</p>
<p>
At the conclusion of this module, we'll give you a reminder to optionally revoke permissions, disable API keys, and perform other preventative safety measures. But in this case, you're only granting permissions to your own code. :)
