# Serverless Architecture
---

While cloud architecture transformed application development, it also introduced challenges of its own.

Most cloud systems used to scale by spinning virtual machines up and down to meet need. This was easier than pre-cloud solutions, but still required a lot of specialized labor, time, and computing resources. As cloud technology evolved, providers aimed to offer even more scaleable, flexible solutions.

## Advent of Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS)

In 2014, Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched the first major serverless product, **Lambda**. Microsoft Azure shortly followed, releasing Azure Functions in 2016. Google Cloud Platform followed with Cloud Functions in 2017.

They may sound complex, but these tools do something _very_ simple: Run a block of code in response to an event.

That's it. The developer writes a modular function, deploys it to the cloud, and invokes it when needed. It runs only when called, and the user is only charged based on the number of times the function runs, and the resources it consumes. This architecture is also referred to as **function-as-a-Service (FaaS)**.

This allows engineers and software organizations to flexibly meet demand, only pay for what they need/use, and save time that might otherwise be spent managing servers.
