## Event-Based Logic with Apps Script  

Great! Our Form works, and it can successfully record responses in our corresponding Google Sheet. Next up, we need to add the ability to run custom code automatically whenever the form is submitted.

This code will ultimately be responsible for beginning the process of creating and sending that automated report to our user...but for now, we'll keep it simple.

To add code to our Google Sheet, we'll click the _Extensions_ option in the upper toolbar. From the resulting dropdown menu, select _Apps Script_:

![Screenshot depicting user selecting the Extensions option from the Google Sheets toolbar, and clicking Apps Script from the resulting dropdown menu](../assets/images/accessing_apps_script_from_google_sheets.png "App Scripts can be accessed by selecting Extensions > Apps Script from the top toolbar in Google Sheets'")

_Note: If you've never used Google Apps Script before, you may be prompted to provide access permissions. Accept all suggested permissions and proceed._

You should be taken to a new project within Apps Script that looks like this:

![Screenshot of in-browser code editor for new Google Apps Script project ](../assets/images/new_apps_script_file_in_browser_editor.png "This is the default view for a new Google Apps Script project")

Let's update the name of our function, and add a quick line of code, like so:

**Code.gs**
```javascript
function onNewFormSubmission(){
  console.log("hey, our function was invoked!")
}
```

Remember, we want to be able to execute our own custom code whenever a new form submission is received. To reflect this, we've given our function a more apt name; `onNewFormSubmission()`. For now, we've included a basic `console.log()` to display a message whenever our function is invoked.

**Important**: Unlike other Google Products, the Apps Script editor will not automatically save your work. After making changes, save your progress by either selecting the save icon in the toolbar, or using the command `CMD + S` on Mac, or `Ctrl + S` on Windows.

### Defining Triggers

In the far-left sidebar of Apps Script, select _Triggers_. Click the blue _Add Trigger_ button in the lower-right corner.

In the resulting pop-up window, select the following configurations:

Let's walk through each:

- We have selected our `onNewFormSubmission()` function to be automatically triggered.
- It will run code from the `Head` deployment. (This is like GitHub Master; no worries for now, just ensure it says head.)
- Our event source is the spreadsheet.
- Event type is Form Submit
- Notification setting is immediately.

In summary, we are stating that our `onNewFormSubmission()` function should run whenever a new form submission is collected by our spreadsheet.

Click the blue _Save_ button.

### Invoking Triggers & Viewing Apps Script Logs 

Now, let's try it out! Revisit the form preview, submit a test submission. We should see this submission appear in our spreadsheet:

Let's see if that `console.log()` in our `onNewFormSubmission()` ran...to do this, we can.... <logs, etc.>

And there it is! We submitted our form, adn our `onnewFormSubmission()` function successfully executed, leaving us a message in the logs.

Great! After these steps, we have a functioning Google Form to accept requests, and we've confirmed our ability to run a function automatically whenever this form is submitted. In our case, we'll want this function to invoke a Google Cloud Function that will pull LMS data and XYZ.

In the next lesson we'll begin creating this Google Cloud function, so that we may connect it to our apps script code!
