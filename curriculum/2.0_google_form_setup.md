# Google Form Setup

---

## Creating a Google Form

First we'll need a Google Form. This will allow stakeholders to request up-to-date LMS metrics on groups of learners in the LMS.

**Click [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WWOQb1rrzaG91OU0jwOK8i9YSo9Ka2eyiJUeLMTUSWU/copy)**, then **_Make a copy_** to make your own copy of the Google Form used in this project. Do not alter the questions or settings provided.

## Saving Form Submissions in a Spreadsheet

We'll configure our form to record responses in a Google Sheet. This will serve as both a record of requests, and an entry point to launch our automated workflow.  

In your copy of the form, select the **_Responses_** tab, then **_Link to Sheets_**.

![Edit view for a Google form](../assets/images/link_form_responses_to_google_sheets.png "Navigate to the 'Responses' tab, then 'Link to Sheets'")

You will be prompted to either select an existing sheet, or make a new sheet. Select **_Create a new spreadsheet_**, then **_Create_**.

Your new sheet will open in the browser.

### Testing the Form

Revisit your Google Form, select **_Preview_** (üëÅÔ∏è) in the upper-right, and submit a response. Confirm that the submission appears in your spreadsheet:
