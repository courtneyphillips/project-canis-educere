# Sending Dynamic Payloads to Cloud Functions
---

Now that our Apps Script has made contact with the cloud, we can begin sending the dynamic data collected by our Google Form.

## Accessing Form Fields

In the `onNewFormSubmission()` function of our Apps Script, we'll add an `event` argument to capture form submission events.

As outlined in [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/events#form-submit), form field data resides in a `values` array on the `event` object. We'll add this data to our HTTP request:

_**Code.gs** in Apps Script_
```JavaScript
const cloudFunctionsLocation = "YOUR-UNIQUE-CLOUD-FUNCTIONS-URL-HERE";

function onNewFormSubmission(event) {
  let payloadToSendToGCP = {
    "method": "POST",
    "contentType": "application/json",
    "payload": JSON.stringify(
      {
        "requestorEmail": event.values[1],
        "orgName": event.values[2]
      }
    )
  }
  let response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(cloudFunctionsLocation, payloadToSendToGCP);
  let result = response.getContentText();
  console.log(result);
}
```

Let's see if we can send form data. We'll submit our form again, revisit Apps Script execution logs, and see a new execution with the same  `Hello World!` message:

Our HTTP request is still functional! But did the Cloud Function receive our new data?

## Logging in Cloud Functions

We'll return to our Cloud Function and select **_Edit_**:

Configuration options will open first. Click **_Next_** without making changes. This will open the inline code editor.

Let's add a `console.log()` to record the body of the HTTP request received by our Cloud Function:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```javascript
exports.helloWorld = (req, res) => {
  let message = req.query.message || req.body.message || 'Hello World!';
  console.log(req.body);
  res.status(200).send(message);
};
```

Click **_Deploy_** to save changes, and wait until a green checkmark indicates a successful deployment.

Then, we'll submit another test form submission in our Google Form.

After submitting new form data, return to Google Cloud Functions and select the **_Logs_** tab. This is where `console.log()`s from Cloud Functions are recorded:

If we scroll to the most recent logs at the bottom, we should see form data. Great! Our dynamic data successfully arrived in the cloud.

| üõ†Ô∏è  Project Note |
|--------------------|
| Not receiving what you expect in your logs? Sometimes deployments take a few moments to get running online, even _after_ displaying a green checkmark.<br><br> Try waiting a few moments and submitting more sample data before pursuing other troubleshooting methods. |
