# Sending Dynamic Payloads to Cloud Functions
---

Now that our Apps Script has made successful contact with the cloud, we can begin sending more relevant data: Like the information users submit through our form.

## Accessing Form Fields

In our Apps Script, we'll add an `event` argument to capture details about the form submission events.

As outlined in [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/events#form-submit), form field data resides in a `values` array on the `event` object. We'll access and send this data in our HTTP request:

**Code.gs** in Apps Script
```JavaScript
const cloudFunctionsLocation = "YOUR-UNIQUE-CLOUD-FUNCTIONS-URL-HERE";

function onNewFormSubmission(event) {
  let payloadToSendToGCP = {
    "method": "POST",
    "contentType": "application/json",
    "payload": JSON.stringify(
      {
        "requestorEmail": event.values[1],
        "orgName": event.values[2],
      }
    )
  }
  let response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(cloudFunctionsLocation, payloadToSendToGCP);
  let result = response.getContentText();
  console.log(result);
}
```

Let's see if it sent. We'll submit our form again, revisit Apps Script execution logs, and see a new execution with the  `Hello World!` message:

Great, our HTTP request is still functional. But did the cloud function receive our form values?

## Logging in Cloud Functions

We'll return to our Cloud Function in the Google Cloud Console, and select **_Edit_**:

Configuration options will open first. Click **_Next_** without making changes.

This will open the inline code editor, where we can alter our Cloud Function logic directly in the browser.

Let's add a `console.log()` to record the body of the HTTP request from Apps Script:

**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions
```javascript
exports.helloWorld = (req, res) => {
  let message = req.query.message || req.body.message || 'Hello World!';
  console.log(req.body);
  res.status(200).send(message);
};
```

Click **_Deploy_** to save changes. This will redirect us to the homepage of our Cloud Function. A green checkmark will appear next to the cloud function name when the deployment is successful. (You'll see an orange warning sign when it's _not_ successful.)

Once our deployment is complete, we'll submit another test form submission in our Google Form.

Then, select the **_Logs_** tab on the Cloud Function homepage to open our logs. This is where `console.log()` items will be recorded:

Scroll to the most recent logs at the bottom to see record of the form data being sent from Google Apps Script!
