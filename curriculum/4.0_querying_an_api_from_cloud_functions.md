# Querying APIs from Cloud Functions
---

Now that we're successfully sending our form data to the cloud, we can use this data to query our LMS API, and start the process of compiling reports.

## Our LMS Data & API

For  this tutorial, we will use a mock LMS REST API constructed especially for this exercise. It contains two types of interrelated objects. It records each `Organization`, like this:

```JSON
{
  "companyName": "LuminaLion",
	"accountHealth": "poor",
	"id": 1,
	"industrySector": "Cloud Computing"
}
```

And each `Learner` like this:

```JSON
{
	"accountCreation": "2020-12-01T21:23:56Z",
	"activeLearningHours": 32,
	"advancedSkillsCertified": "false",
	"devOpsCertified": "in progress",
	"email": "ydyaewhmd@tqixh.tb",
	"fundamentalsCertified": "true",
	"id": 1,
	"kubernetesCertified": "false",
	"name": "Karis Martinez",
	"organizationId": 10,
	"roleType": "DevOps"
}
```

Notice that each each `Learner` belongs to an `Organization` by means of an `OrganizationId` value. Additionally, each `Learner` record contains details on progress in various certification programs.

## Cloud Function Entry Points

Let's revisit the Cloud Functions inline editor and write a new function to query this API. We'll replace `helloWorld()` with something new:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```JavaScript
exports.serveLmsReports = () => {

};
```

This function, `serveLmsReports()` will be our new entry point. We must update the _**Entry point**_ field to reflect this:

![Screenshot of entry point and function name matching in inline gcp code editor](../assets/images/updating_entry_point_name.png)

**If the entry point specified is not available, the cloud function will not execute correctly.**

## Constructing HTTP Requests

Next we'll construct a request to contact the API. Because we selected Node.js 16 as our runtime environment, we have access to Node's built-in [HTTPS Module](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html).

We'll require the module at the top of our file, and scaffold an empty request using HTTPS library syntax:  

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```JavaScript
const https = require('https');

exports.serveLmsReports = (req, res) => {

  https.get(url, (response) => {
    // what do we do with the response we'll get back?

    response.on('end', () => {
      // what should happen when the HTTP request concludes?
    });

  }).on('error', (err) => {
    // what should happen if the HTTP request hits an error?
  });

};
```

We begin an HTTP GET request with `get()`, and attach `on()` listeners to react to two potential events:  

- `end`, referring to the successful end of data transmission from the API, via the HTTPS library.

- `error`, referring to an error event that prevents successful execution.

We'll add our API endpoint URL, and specify what to do with returned API data:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```JavaScript
const https = require('https');

exports.serveLmsReports = (req, res) => {
  let url = 'https://mockend.com/courtneyphillips/canis-educere-mock-api/organization?companyName_eq=' + encodeURIComponent(req.body.orgName);

  https.get(url, (response) => {
    let data = '';
    response.on('data', (chunk) => {
      data += chunk;
    });

    response.on('end', () => {
      // what should happen when the HTTP request concludes?
    });

  }).on('error', (err) => {
    // what should happen if the HTTP request hits an error?
  });

};
```

A few notes about the code above:

- Notice we're constructing a query string from the form data included on the original HTTP request from our Apps Script.

- In the HTTPS tool, data is returned in a stream of small "chunks" instead of one big payload. This allows clients to begin processing data before it's all received, and helps reduce network issues.

- In our code above, we accumulate each `chunk` of data into a singular `data` variable as it's received.

- After all chunks are received, the `response` will emit an `end` event.

Let's specify what should occur upon `end`:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```JavaScript
const https = require('https');

exports.serveLmsReports = (req, res) => {
  let url = 'https://mockend.com/courtneyphillips/canis-educere-mock-api/organization?companyName_eq=' + encodeURIComponent(req.body.orgName);

  https.get(url, (response) => {
    let data = '';
    response.on('data', (chunk) => {
      data += chunk;
    });

    response.on('end', () => {
      const parsedOrgData = JSON.parse(data);
      console.log("CHECK OUT THIS DATA WE JUST GOT! WOW!");
      console.log(parsedOrgData);
      res.status(200).send("Request successfully processed by the contactLMS function in GCP!")
    });

  }).on('error', (err) => {
    // what should happen if the HTTP request hits an error?
  });

};
```

Here we parse data retrieved from the API, log it in the console, and send a `200 'OK'` status response and success message.

We'll also specify what should happen in case of `error`:

_**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions_
```JavaScript
const https = require('https');

exports.serveLmsReports = (req, res) => {
  let url = 'https://mockend.com/courtneyphillips/canis-educere-mock-api/organization?companyName_eq=' + encodeURIComponent(req.body.orgName);
  https.get(url, (response) => {
    let data = '';
    response.on('data', (chunk) => {
      data += chunk;
    });
    response.on('end', () => {
      const parsedOrgData = JSON.parse(data);
      console.log("CHECK OUT THIS DATA WE JUST GOT! WOW!");
      console.log(parsedOrgData);
      res.status(200).send("Request successfully processed by the contactLMS function in GCP!")
    });
  }).on('error', (err) => {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).send('Oh no, there was an error in processing your request. Check Logs for GCP and Apps Scripts.');
  });
};
```

Here, we simply log the error, and send a `500` response and error message back.

Use the blue **_Deploy_** button to save and launch these changes.

After code is successfully deployed to the Cloud Function, we can submit a sample form again, access our cloud function logs, and see freshly-retrieved API data!
