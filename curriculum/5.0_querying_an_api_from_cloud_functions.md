# Querying APIs from Cloud Functions
---

We've confirmed our Google Form is triggering an Apps Script, which then sends form data to our Google Cloud Function. Now that we have this data in the cloud, we can use it to query our LMS database.

| For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be using a mock LMS REST API constructed for this exercise. For details and documentation, review the [Mock API Repository](https://github.com/courtneyphillips/canis-educere-mock-api) on GitHub.  |

## HTTP Requests from Cloud Functions

Let's revisit the inline editor of the Google Cloud Console, and write our new method to contact the LMS API. First we'll remove our `helloWorld()` function, and replace it with something new:

**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions
```JavaScript
exports.serveLmsReports = () => {

};
```

This `serveLmsReports()` function will be our new entry point. That is, the logic that _always_ runs first when our Cloud Function is triggered. You must update the entry point field above the inline code editor to reflect our new method name:

**If the entry point specified is not available, the cloud function will not execute correctly.**

**index.js** in Google Cloud Functions
```JavaScript
const https = require('https');

exports.contactLMS = (req, res) => {
  let url = 'https://mockend.com/courtneyphillips/canis-educere-mock-api/organization?companyName_eq=' + encodeURIComponent(req.body.orgName);

  https.get(url, (response) => {
    // what do we do with the response we'll get back?

    response.on('end', () => {
      // what should happen when the HTTP request concludes?
    });

  }).on('error', (err) => {
    // what should happen if the HTTP request hits an error?
  });

};
```

**index.js** in the Google Cloud Functions Console
```JavaScript
const https = require('https');

exports.contactLMS = (req, res) => {
  let url = 'https://mockend.com/courtneyphillips/canis-educere-mock-api/organization?companyName_eq=' + encodeURIComponent(req.body.orgName);

  https.get(url, (response) => {
    let data = '';
    response.on('data', (chunk) => {
      data += chunk;
    });

    response.on('end', () => {
      // what should happen when the HTTP request concludes?
    });

  }).on('error', (err) => {
    // what should happen if the HTTP request hits an error?
  });

};
```

When using the https library in node, as we are here, the responding server emits a series of data events as chunks of data are received. The response.on() method is used to register a callback function that will be called each time a data event is emitted by the response object.

In this specific code, the callback function appends the received data chunks to a variable called data. The += operator is used to concatenate the chunk of data to the data variable. This way, the data is accumulated as the response is received in chunks.

After the response is completely received, the response object emits a end event, indicating that the response has been fully received. At this point, the complete response data can be processed using the accumulated data variable.

So, this code is used to handle and accumulate the response data from an HTTP/HTTPS request made using the https library in Node.js.

When a client makes an HTTP/HTTPS request to a server, the server responds with the data requested by the client. The data returned by the server can be of any size, ranging from small responses to large files.

To ensure efficient data transmission over the internet and avoid congestion, data is transmitted in small chunks instead of a single large block. This allows the data to be streamed to the client in small pieces, enabling the client to begin processing the data before the entire response is received. This also helps to optimize network utilization, as the transmission of large files can be interrupted or disrupted due to network issues.

So, in the case of an HTTP/HTTPS request made using the https library in Node.js, the response data is received in small chunks because the server sends the data in small packets to optimize the network utilization and reduce the chance of network congestion or interruptions. The code snippet mentioned in the previous question accumulates these data chunks as they are received and processes them as a single entity when the entire response has been received.

**index.js** in the Google Cloud Functions Console
```JavaScript
const https = require('https');

exports.contactLMS = (req, res) => {
  let url = 'https://mockend.com/courtneyphillips/canis-educere-mock-api/organization?companyName_eq=' + encodeURIComponent(req.body.orgName);

  https.get(url, (response) => {
    let data = '';
    response.on('data', (chunk) => {
      data += chunk;
    });

    response.on('end', () => {
      const parsedOrgData = JSON.parse(data);
      let parsedLearnerData = retrieveOrgLearnerData(parsedOrgData);
      let emailConfirmation = compileAndSendEmailReport(parsedOrgData, parsedLearnerData);
      res.status(200).send("Request successfully processed by the contactLMS function in GCP!")
    });

  }).on('error', (err) => {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).send('Oh no, there was an error in processing your request. Check Logs for GCP and Apps Scripts.');
  });

};
```

      console.log("CHECK OUT THIS DATA WE JUST GOT! WOW!");
      console.log(parsedOrgData);
      res.status(200).send("Request successfully processed by the contactLMS function in GCP!")
    });
  }).on('error', (err) => {
    console.error(err);
