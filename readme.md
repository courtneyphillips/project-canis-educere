### Topic

This brief learning module will provide a quick, hands-on introduction to Serverless programming and systems design using Google Cloud Platform.

The first half of the module will walk through the terminology, concepts, trends, and concepts necessary to understand serverless systems in context.

After discussing the basics, the second half of this lesson will offer a hands-on tutorial for writing and executing a serverless function in Google Cloud Platform.

Finally, we'll wrap up by discussing , and recommending additional resources and next steps for learners who wish to continue their serverless journey.

### Audience

### Prerequisite Knowledge

This module is designed for learners familiar with:

- Simple HTTP requests, especially in the context of APIs
- RESTful API structure
- Fundamental JavaScript syntax and logic, including defining and exporting functions, basic callbacks, and handling simple asynchronous requests
- Node.js, including foundational syntax, npm package management, etc.
- Simple JSON navigation, including constructing, stringifying, and parsing data  

### Learning Objectives

After completing this module, learners will be able to:

- Create and invoke event-based triggers in Google Apps Scripts.
- Follow best practices to obfuscate sensitive values in Google Cloud Platform using Google Cloud Secrets Manager
- Bridge two disparate APIs by means of cloud functions
- Create, configure, and access a new project in Google Cloud Platform
- Author and deploy a basic Cloud Function in JavaScript and Node.js using Google Cloud Platform
- Access, review, and analyze execution logs for both Google Apps Script and Google Cloud Functions
- Create, execute, and manage interdependent HTTP GET and POST requests from cloud functions
- Obfuscate and access sensitive keys in the cloud using Google Secrets Manager
- Identify and explain use cases for Cloud Functions (vs. other logic solutions)
- Describe the relationship between cloud computing, functions-as-a-service, and serverless functions.
- Articulate the value of serverless functions.  
- Construct and execute a serverless function on Google Cloud Platform.
- Identify potential use cases for serverless functions.

### Tools and Services  

Lessons in this module will walk through accessing and using the following tools. Instructions and resources for each will be provided when they appear in the module:    

- Google Suite: Used to create and operate Forms, Spreadsheets, and basic Apps Script.
- Google Cloud Platform: Specific focus on Cloud Functions, and Secrets Manager.
- A SendGrid API:
- Mocked LMS API: See API repo & readme for more details.
