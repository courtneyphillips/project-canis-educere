### Topic

This brief learning module will provide a hands-on introduction to Serverless programming using Google Cloud Functions.

After a brief introduction to serverless terminology and contexdt, we'll begin creating .

### Audience

### Prerequisite Knowledge

This module is designed for learners familiar with:

- Simple HTTP requests, especially in the context of APIs
- RESTful API structure
- Fundamental JavaScript syntax and logic, including defining and exporting functions, basic callbacks, and handling simple asynchronous requests
- Node.js, including foundational syntax, npm package management, etc.
- Simple JSON navigation, including constructing, stringifying, and parsing data  

### Learning Objectives

After completing this module, learners will be able to:

- Create and invoke event-based triggers in Google Apps Scripts.
- Follow best practices to obfuscate sensitive values in Google Cloud Platform using Google Cloud Secrets Manager
- Bridge two disparate APIs by means of cloud functions
- Create, configure, and access a new project in Google Cloud Platform
- Author and deploy a basic Cloud Function in JavaScript and Node.js using Google Cloud Platform
- Access, review, and analyze execution logs for both Google Apps Script and Google Cloud Functions
- Create, execute, and manage interdependent HTTP GET and POST requests from cloud functions
- Obfuscate and access sensitive keys in the cloud using Google Secrets Manager
- Identify and explain use cases for Cloud Functions (vs. other logic solutions)
- Describe the relationship between cloud computing, functions-as-a-service, and serverless functions.
- Articulate the value of serverless functions.  
- Construct and execute a serverless function on Google Cloud Platform.
- Identify potential use cases for serverless functions.

### Tools and Services  

The following tools and services are used in this tutorial. Learners will need a Google account and email address. No other pre-emptive setup is required. lessons will walk through accessing and configuring each as they're required:   

- Google Suite: Used to create and operate Forms, Spreadsheets, and basic Apps Script.
- Google Cloud Platform: Specific focus on Cloud Functions, and Secrets Manager.
- A SendGrid API:
- Mocked LMS API: See API repo & readme for more details.
